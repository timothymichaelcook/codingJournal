Working on HTML in Codecademy

STRUCTURE IN HTML
Learned about relative vs absolute paths:
relative = ./aboutme.html 
absolute = www.google.com


attributes are inside tags, for the anchor tag, it could have the href and target attributes.

<a href="./test.html" target="_blank"></a>


For readability, use Whitespace and nesting.

instead of:
<body><p>Text</p></body>

do:
<body>
  <p>Text</p>
<body>


TABLES IN HTML

tables are started with tr tag
td tag specifies how many columns are in the row

<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td></td>
  <td></td>
  
 
    The <table> element creates a table.
    The <tr> element adds rows to a table.
    To add data to a row, you can use the <td> element.
    Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th> element.
    Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
    Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
    Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
    A table’s head is created with the <thead> element.
    A table’s body is created with the <tbody> element.
    A table’s footer is created with the <tfoot> element.
    All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.

</tr>


tbody is used with larger tables
