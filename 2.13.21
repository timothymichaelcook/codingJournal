Working on HTML in Codecademy

STRUCTURE IN HTML
Learned about relative vs absolute paths:
relative = ./aboutme.html 
absolute = www.google.com


attributes are inside tags, for the anchor tag, it could have the href and target attributes.

<a href="./test.html" target="_blank"></a>


For readability, use Whitespace and nesting.

instead of:
<body><p>Text</p></body>

do:
<body>
  <p>Text</p>
<body>

tables are started with tr tag
td tag specifies how many columns are in the row

<tr>
  <th></th>
  <th></th>
</tr>
<tr>
